kairosclerosis
n. The moment you realize that you're currently happy consciously trying to savor the feeling which prompts your intellect to identify it, pick it apart and put it in context, where it will slowly dissolve until its little more than an aftertaste.

Kairosclerosis is from the Greek: kairos, "the opportune moment" + sclerosis, "hardening."
~ Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows
%
The Ancient Greeks had two words for time, chronos and kairos. Chronos is quantitative and linear the ticking of the Western clock. Kairos is more qualitative, referring to moments that are indeterminate and sublime, when something special happens, when god speaks or the wind shifts, when a door is left open between one minute and the next.
This definition is why I ain't writing The Dictionary of Obscure Pleasures. In my experience, moments of joy tend to die on the examination table. Kurt Vonnegut liked to say, I urge you to please notice when you are happy, and exclaim or murmur or think at some point, If this isn't nice, I don't know what is. I think the opposite is true. Notice when you're sad, and dive in and wallow and examine it and pick it apart with forceps and calipers. The sadness will lose its vitality and harden over time into something benign and foreign, like an emotional fossil.
