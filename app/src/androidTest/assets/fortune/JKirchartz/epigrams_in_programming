%
EPIGRAMS IN PROGRAMMING
49. Giving up on assembly language was the apple in our Garden of Eden: Languages whose use squanders machine cycles are sinful. The LISP machine now permits LISP programmers to abandon bra and fig-leaf.

%
EPIGRAMS IN PROGRAMMING
72. An adequate bootstrap is a contradiction in terms.
%
EPIGRAMS IN PROGRAMMING
